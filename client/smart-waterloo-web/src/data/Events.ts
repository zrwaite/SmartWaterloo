		"description": "At KW YBA we believe all sports are a gateway for children, at any age, to learn about teamwork, leadership and life's skills. Both our house league and rep teams introduce your sons and daughters to these concepts and more. There are two main areas of focus for the YBA program: to have FUN, and to develop basketball skills and knowledge. Our youngest age group does not keep score for most of the season, focusing on the play on the court, not on who may have won or lost. We are developing young players, coaches and officials at that level. We offer coaching clinics to all our coaches. The YBA house league program begins for players 8 years and older. We have allowed some 7-year-olds if they have completed at least one Jr. NBA Rookie Division session. Our oldest division group players range in ages from 15 to 18. The rep program (Vipers) has various teams for players ranged from 8 to 18 years of age. The YBA is an incorporated, not-for-profit organizations whose mandate is to provide a full range of basketball experiences to as many families as possible. We are inclusive and will make sure that finances do not hinder anyone's desire to become part of us.",
